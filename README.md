## üîß Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm getting Node.js module errors when running `npm start`**
A: Try the alternative commands:
- `npm run start:tsx` (recommended for Node.js v20+)
- `npm run start:alt` (uses custom loader)

**Q: How do I add new seed accounts?**
A: Use `npm run add-seeds` or `npm run add-single-seed` and edit the corresponding script files.

**Q: Why do I need a Google service account?**
A: To append leads to your Google Sheet automatically. Share your sheet with the service account email.

**Q: What if Instagram blocks or rate-limits me?**
A: The tool has built-in delays and rate limiting, but you should avoid running too aggressively. If blocked, wait 24 hours and try again.

**Q: How does the tool detect professions?**
A: It uses advanced keyword/context matching and can optionally use OpenAI for ambiguous cases.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
A: Yes, but you are responsible for complying with Instagram's terms and all applicable laws.

**Q: Where are checked accounts tracked?**
A: In `src/config/leadCheckpoint.json` to avoid duplicates and optimize discovery.

**Q: How do I get Discord notifications?**
A: Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in your `.env` file. Use `npm run test-discord` to verify.

**Q: What if I get errors with Google Sheets?**
A: Ensure your `SHEET_ID` is correct, your service account has access, and the sheet/tab exists (default: `Leads`).

**Q: How do I update the qualification criteria?**
A: Edit `src/config/settings.json` to change follower limits, locations, professions, and batch sizes.
